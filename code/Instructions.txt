For JOGL:
On windows, copy the .dll files from the jogl-natives-win32.jar to:
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_09\jre\bin
On linux, copy the .so files from the jogl-natives-linux.jar to:
/usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun/jre/lib/i386/client
Then running the code from either console or Ant will work.

For JInput:
Go to https://jinput.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList and download
the latest build zip for your OS. Dump the jinput.jar file into jogl/runtime/controller.
Put the native library file in whichever path is listed under the JOGL instructions,
for your OS.

For JInput in linux: chmod 644 the contents of /dev/input


Once the jars are all built and running and such, use "prep for web".
